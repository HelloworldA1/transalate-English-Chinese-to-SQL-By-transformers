# transalate-English-Chinese-to-SQL-By-transformers
This project is only an experiment, in which an English database description and corresponding operation statements were attempted as input. The English data can be found at https://github.com/taoyds/spider/tree/master. In addition, there is a bit of Chinese dataset inside, which is very small and almost meaningless.
